# Static Portfolio QA

Tested against the repository-ready ZIP contents on 2026-11-09. This is a local static-page test, not a live Vercel deployment test.

## Main site

- Eight case records render.
- Initial featured case resolves to the Dify case.
- Work index opens and lists all eight cases.
- Systems filter returns three records.
- Laya case opens and reveals the standalone casebook CTA.
- No horizontal overflow at 1440px, 390px, or 360px viewport widths.
- No browser JavaScript errors observed.

## Laya casebook

- Eight chapters and eight chapter visuals render.
- Chapter disclosure interaction works.
- Four evidence-scenario controls respond and update their selected state.
- No browser JavaScript errors observed.

## Limitations

- This does not verify live external links, Vercel routing, domain configuration, or team permission for project media.
- The older modular authoring package contains a stale `patch_mainline.py` migration script and stale smoke-test assertions; it was not used as the deployment source.


## 2026-11-09 review-branch delta

The following changes were made after the repository-ready ZIP QA above. This addendum does **not** claim that the new branch has received a full browser/E2E pass.

### Changed

- Vivic case: replaced the generic capture → card → confirm journey with a five-part decision/execution responsibility explainer (deterministic rules, model decision, host validation/execution, structured recovery, and result receipt).
- Vivic outcome: added project-internal 60-item API regression, p50 latency, and estimated token-cost evidence with explicit sample and measurement caveats. Added role-attribution, frontend-completion, and media-permission boundaries.
- Cherry Studio #21015: added a synthetic, clearly labelled All / Failed interaction demonstrating the read-only filter semantics. It is not an official product screenshot or real model-check dataset.
- Contribution index: expanded to eight selected upstream project groups. PR counts and links were checked against GitHub author/merged queries on 2026-11-09.

### Static checks performed on this branch

- Parsed the embedded case, case-detail, contribution, and Vivic-step data blocks.
- Confirmed eight case records, a matching detail record for each, eight contribution groups, and five Vivic steps.
- Confirmed Cherry filter controls, delegated click handling, and initial state wiring are present.
- Confirmed the metrics block is rendered only for the Vivic case.
- Ran Node syntax checking against the newly added interaction snippets.
- Confirmed page-level noindex, robots.txt crawler blocking, and Vercel X-Robots-Tag remain in place.

### Not performed on this branch

- No full browser render or E2E pass after these changes.
- No new 1440 / 390 / 360px viewport regression pass.
- No live Vercel preview, production deployment, custom-domain change, or search-indexing change.
- No VIVIC private screenshot reuse or team-permission assumption.

The earlier ZIP QA results above remain historical evidence for that ZIP only; they must not be treated as validation of this review-branch delta.
